# Setting Up a Basic Package in [R](https://cran.r-project.org/ "R")

There are several ways to set up an R-Package, in this course we are going to use [R-Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/ "R-Studio") in conjunction with **Rtools** and the next R-packages:
* [devtools](https://devtools.r-lib.org/ "devtools")
* [roxygen2](https://github.com/klutometis/roxygen "roxygen2")

So, before following the instructions shown in "R_Package.pdf" be sure you have installed **Rtools** (for this check "First_Step.pdf") and the R-packages mentioned above.
